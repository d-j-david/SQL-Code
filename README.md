### ConfigureTbl

Cleans the specified table by removing leftover text qualifiers, changing blank strings
 to nulls, 
and converting cells that contain only 'NULL' to nulls as well. Optionally, can also detect the
datatype of each field, and convert/format appropriately, as well as clean field headers to a name
that does not require brackets.

The procedure was built for SQL Server 2014.
